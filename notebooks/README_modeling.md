# Modeling & Segment Evaluation (Notebook 2)

> Building and comparing multiple demand forecasting models across 300 SKUs (Product Ã— Region Ã— Channel), with performance evaluation by segment to simulate real-world volatility handling.

---

## Goals

- Build a forecasting pipeline using engineered features (lags, seasonality, promotions, lifecycle, etc.)
- Train and tune a range of models from simple baselines to advanced ML and deep learning
- Improve accuracy through regularization, hyperparameter tuning, and interpretability
- Compare model performance at both global and segment (SKU cluster) level
- Identify scalable forecasting strategies for production use

## Segment-Level Performance

Demand volatility segments were defined in Notebook 1 using clustering. Models were evaluated across:

| Demand Cluster              | Excellent | Good | Weak |
|----------------------------|-----------|------|------|
| Low Demand / Stable        | 129       | 36   | 7    |
| Medium Demand / Stable     | 104       | â€”    | â€”    |
| High Demand / Volatile     | 18        | â€”    | â€”    |
| Very High Demand / Volatile| 6         | â€”    | â€”    |

> Segment-based evaluation highlights model strengths in stable segments and exposes weaknesses in highly volatile demand â€” critical insight for real-world deployment.

## Key Takeaways

 - Basic statistical models like Naive Forecast and GLM gave us a decent starting point, but they couldnâ€™t handle more complex patterns in the data.
 - Regularized models like Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet did better â€” but they were still limited compared to more flexible models like LightGBM.
 - LightGBM performed the best overall â€” especially when combined with engineered features and hyperparameter tuning.
 - Deep learning models (LSTM, CNN) were included, but didnâ€™t match LightGBMâ€™s performance on this structured, feature-rich dataset.
 - Thatâ€™s not unexpected â€” deep learning tends to need more tuning and deeper input sequences to work well on tabular data.
 - At the segment level, LightGBM consistently did better in stable demand groups, making it a strong choice for real-world forecasting tasks.
