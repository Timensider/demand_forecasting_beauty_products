# Beauty Product Demand Forecasting

> A real-world ML pipeline for forecasting weekly demand across global beauty product SKUs ‚Äî from raw business data to deployable predictions.

This project simulates an end-to-end machine learning solution for forecasting demand for hundreds of global beauty product SKUs across regions and channels. It includes:

- Exploratory analysis & feature engineering
- Statistical, ML, and deep learning models
- Segment-aware evaluation
- Deployment-ready code

Built to reflect real-world business forecasting needs ‚Äî including volatility, seasonality, promotional effects, and demand segmentation.

---

## Key Highlights

- **300 pseudo-SKUs** generated as combinations of product, region, and sales channel (50x3x2)
- **Best Model**: LightGBM with R¬≤ = **0.9888**
- Segment-level performance analysis across volatility clusters
- Real-time scoring pipeline included
